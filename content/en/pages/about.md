## Who am I?

Hello! ðŸ˜„

First, thank you for visiting my blog. I am **Carlos Ruiz**, a Software and Computer Engineer, currently living in Madrid, Spain.

My idea with this blog is to organize and share the things I learn and am interested in about software development, DevOps, and other technology-related stuff, in order to use it as a reference for future videos that I am planning to create on YouTube and some other software projects that I would like to create.

That's me down here :point_down: :point_down: :point_down:

## Work Experience

Currently, I am working with the team at [OpenVidu](https://openvidu.io/), a WebRTC platform for video conferencing, streaming, recording... developed by the research group [CodeURJC](https://www.codeurjc.es/) from the [Rey Juan Carlos University](https://www.urjc.es/).

Previously, I was in the Artificial Intelligence Research Group [GIA](http://www.ia.urjc.es/GIA/es/) of the same university, and at [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/), during my company internship.

## Collaborations

I have collaborated with several startups:
- [Rated Power](https://ratedpower.com/): I implemented some features to improve their scalability and their CI/CD system.
- [TwoToForty](http://twotoforty.com/): A startup aimed at helping human resources departments improve their hiring process. I worked as a developer for their web application.

## Publications

During my time at GIA, I collaborated on two publications:

- [**Balance Strategies for Bike Sharing Systems**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17294-7_16)
- [**A Bike Sharing System Simulator**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94779-2_37)

## Side Projects

I like to create tools mainly related to Docker and Linux. I love creating projects that can remove the friction when starting to develop new projects, or eliminate the mental load of carrying multiple projects at the same time.

In the end, it all comes down to the fact that I like to create tools that make my life easier, and if they can serve someone else... much better ðŸ˜‰!

- **ubuntu-dind**: A Docker image with Ubuntu and Docker-in-Docker.

- **desktopus**: Your Linux desktop as code, anywhere.

## Languages & Technologies I used

- Linux (Including bash scripting, basic system administration, etc.)
- Docker & Kubernetes
- IaC Tools (Ansible, CloudFormation)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- Backend with Java with Spring Boot, Node.js with Express, Typescript, Golang and Python.
- Frontend with Angular (Yeah, I am missing some of the trendy stuff happening here...)
- Databases (MySQL, Redis)
- Cloud Providers (Mainly AWS)
- Git (obviously)
- Basic networking knowledge mainly because of WebRTC headaches
- I am probably forgetting something, but you get the idea...
