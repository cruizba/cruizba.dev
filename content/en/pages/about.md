Hello there! Take a look to this guy: :point_down: :point_down: :point_down:

![**Carlos Ruiz**](/about.jpg)

That's me, probably in the middle of troubleshooting something at my current workplace, [**OpenVidu**](https://openvidu.io/). I'm just a small piece of the incredible team behind this project, and I'm immensely proud to be a part of it. That's why it's the first thing I'm mentioning on my "about me" page :joy:.

My name is **Carlos Ruiz, a Software and Informatics Engineer** from Spain and currently residing in Madrid. I studied my degree and a master's in **Information Systems Engineering** from the **University Rey Juan Carlos**. With roughly 9 years of experience, I continue to learn and grow every day.

Right now, I'm employed at [**Code URJC**](https://www.codeurjc.es/), a research group from University Rey Juan Carlos, where I'm contributing to the [**OpenVidu**](https://openvidu.io/) project. I've learned a lot about software development there, and continue to do so. Working with WebRTC isn't a walk in the park, but that's exactly why OpenVidu is successful - we simplify it for developers. Creating a platform for other developers is both challenging and rewarding.

Before joining [**Code URJC**](https://www.codeurjc.es/), I was part of the Research Group of Artificial Intelligence at URJC [**GIA**](http://www.ia.urjc.es/GIA/es/). During this time, I was involved in developing a bike sharing system simulator, which significantly expanded my understanding of practical AI applications. I have also collaborated with two publications:

- [**Balancing Strategies for Bike Sharing Systems**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17294-7_16)
- [**A Bike Sharing System Simulator**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94779-2_37)

Before this, I spent my initial year with [**CGI**](https://www.cgi.com/). Although my tenure there lasted only a few months, it was an incredibly enriching experience. I honed my skills in Java and Spring, and gained valuable insights into the consulting world and the practical aspects of software development.

While at [**Code URJC**](https://www.codeurjc.es/), I've also collaborated with startups like [**Rated Power**](https://ratedpower.com/), where I implemented features to enhance scalability and the CI/CD system. It's another fantastic project with an equally fantastic team, and it was a rewarding experience.

I also write some side projects in my spare time that for some reason, takes some attention from the community:

- **ubuntu-dind**: A Docker image with Ubuntu and Docker-in-Docker. It's useful for CI/CD pipelines.

- **desktopus**: A generator of docker linux desktop images. **Stay tuned for this project, I have great plans for it :sunglasses:.**

As I write this, I'm planning to create YouTube videos about software, Docker, and related topics, and also develop a software project I've been thinking about. But I'll share more about that once I have something to show. **Stay tuned! :winking_face:.**
